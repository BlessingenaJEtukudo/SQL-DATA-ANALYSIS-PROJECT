## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 

Case Scenario I
1. Which product category had the highest sales?
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom
10 customers
5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

Case Scenario II

6. Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically
purchase?
7. Which small business customer had the highest sales?
8. Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 – 2012?
9. Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?
10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

Marketing campaigns and sales team should be focused on the high performing regions while the low performing regions should be looked into to check what is responsible for their performance

If Express Air was heavily used for Low-priority orders → shipping cost is being misused.

If Delivery Truck is used mostly for Low-priority orders → shipping is efficient.

Implement shipping rules in the system that enforce appropriate methods based on order priority.

Train staff or automate shipping selections to reduce unnecessary cost.
